Description of program:
once a pasenger has completed thier travel, they add a point (+1) to the balance for each step that they are at thier destination.
my program has 10 passengers, 5 cars, and 5 stations and the set up portion is well-excuted
I attempted to code for the simulation but I was not ultimately successfull.



challenges:
1) A particular challenge I had was with my visual outputs. Reading the outputs was initially confusing and jankly process which made it difficult to solve problems within my code.



componenets I'm proud of:

1) my code's ability to track of information and the fact that it's able to produce the location of each car and accuratley display when a passenger is at their destination. 
2) the raw methods in my code; as I read and re-read through my code manytimes alongside my comments, and the simulation pretty much makes sense to me. What my code lacks is pure excecution even though I belive that I have all the methods needed. I'm sure that somewhere within my code there are a couple errors that I somehow haven't been able to catch yet. 


Thank you.
